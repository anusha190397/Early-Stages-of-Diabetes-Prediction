Early Stages of Diabetes Prediction

This project aims to predict the early stages of diabetes using various classification models. Among the models tested, the Support Vector Machine (SVM) model achieved the highest recall rate of 80%, outperforming other models.

Diabetes is a chronic disease that affects millions of people worldwide. Early detection can help in managing and mitigating the adverse effects of the disease. This project explores the use of machine learning classification models to predict the early stages of diabetes based on a set of health indicators.

Dataset

The dataset used is taken from the UCI repository. It contains various health indicators of patients, which are used to predict the likelihood of diabetes. The dataset includes features such as glucose level, cholesterol, alcohol consumption, blood pressure, insulin level, BMI, age, and others.

The following classification models were tested in this project:

Support Vector Machine (SVM)
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
Decision Tree
Neural Networks
Naive Bayes
Random Forest
Ensemble models

The SVM model demonstrated the highest recall rate of 80%, making it the most effective at predicting the early stages of diabetes. This ensures that fewer cases of diabetes are missed, which is critical for early intervention and treatment.
